# Overview
<center>
<img src="figs/ptr.png" width="80%">
</center>
In this work, we propose prompt tuning with rules (PTR) for many-class text classification and apply logic rules to construct prompts with several sub-prompts. In this way, PTR is able to encode prior knowledge of each class into prompt tuning. You can find more details in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11259.pdf).

# Requirements

The model is implemented using PyTorch. The versions of packages used are shown below.

+ numpy==1.18.0
+ scikit-learn==0.22.1
+ scipy==1.4.1
+ torch==1.4.0
+ tqdm==4.41.1
+ transformers==4.0.0

To set up the dependencies, you can run the following command:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data Preparation
We have provided a scripts to download all the datasets we used in our paper. You can run the following command to download the datasets:
```bash
bash data/download.sh all
```
The above command will download all the datasets including
+ Retacred
+ Tacred
+ Tacrev
+ Semeval

If you only want to download a specific dataset, you can run the following command:
```bash
bash data/download.sh $dataset_name1 $dataset_name2 ...
```
where `$dataset_nameX` can be one or multiple of `retacred`, `tacred`, `tacrev`, `semeval`.

## Baselines

Some baselines, especially the baselines using entity markers, come from the project [[RE_improved_baseline]](https://github.com/wzhouad/RE_improved_baseline).
